# Liquid Galaxy Flutter Default Workflow

When the user asks to create a Liquid Galaxy Flutter application:

1. Run lg-init to understand the project context.
2. Run lg-brainstormer to clarify the idea and visual requirements.
3. Run lg-plan-writer to design the Flutter structure and features.
4. Run lg-exec to implement the app step-by-step using the starter kit.
5. Run lg-code-reviewer to verify architecture and LG compatibility.
6. Run lg-quiz-master to reinforce learning.

Rules:

- Always use the LG Flutter Starter Kit architecture.
- Never generate custom SSH or raw LG command logic.
- Always reuse starter services.
- Ensure the app is reusable and not hardcoded.
